This Quiz was as a SPA using Javascript on the BackEnd and localstorage to save information. The goal of this project was to demostrate that I can change the DOM

## Quiz Elements

The quiz have 4 Views all created inside a javascript variable

1. Main

2.  Quiz.- The quiz is defined on the code inside of a variable, what I do is to suffle the questions in order to not have the same order when the quiz is activated

        1. Timer.- I used to show the total time that the person have to answer the quiz and if the answer is correct the timer decrease by 10 seconds. Once the timer is 0 the Game is Over
        2. Validation .- Here I can validate if the answer is correct according to the question
        3. Score count.- Once the validation is running I can count the possitive answers
